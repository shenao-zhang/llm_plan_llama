You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 2, a desk 1, a drawer 6, a drawer 5, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a laundryhamper 1, a safe 1, a shelf 6, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, and a shelf 1.
Your task is to: look at bowl under the desklamp.
Cumulative reward dominates!
critic: My task requires four sub-goals in order: find a bowl, take the bowl, find a desklamp, and use the desklamp. My current state satisfies zero of the four sub-goals. The value is 0/4=0.
0> go to desk 2
On the desk 2, you see a alarmclock 1, a bowl 1, and a cd 3.
1> think: Now I find a bowl (1). Next, I need to take it.
OK.
2> take bowl 1 from desk 2
You pick up the bowl 1 from the desk 2.
Cumulative reward dominates!
critic: Now I find a bowl (1). My current state satisfies the first of the four sub-goals: find a bowl. The value is 1/4=0.25.
3> think: Now I take a bowl (1). Next, I need to find a desklamp. A desklamp is more likely to appear in desk (1-2), drawer (1-6), shelf (1-6), laundryhamper (1), garbagecan (1), safe (1). I can check one by one without repetition.
OK.
4> go to laundryhamper 1
On the laundryhamper 1, you see nothing.
5> go to garbagecan 1
On the garbagecan 1, you see a cd 1.
Value estimation dominates!
6> go to desk 1
On the desk 1, you see a desklamp 1, a keychain 3, a mug 2, a pen 2, a pen 1, and a pencil 2.
critic: Now I find a desklamp (1). My current state satisfies the first two of the four sub-goals: find a bowl and find a desklamp. The value is 2/4=0.5.
7> think: Now I find a desklamp (1). Next, I need to use it.
OK.
8> use desklamp 1
You turn on the desklamp 1.

Your task is to: put two soapbar in garbagecan.
Cumulative reward dominates!
critic: My current state satisfies the first sub-goal: put two soapbar in garbagecan. The value is 1/1.
0> go to handtowelholder 2
On the handtowelholder 2, you see a handtowel 1.
critic: My current state satisfies the second sub-goal: put two handtowel in handtowelholder. The value is 2/1.
1> take handtowel 1 from handtowelholder 2
You pick up the handtowel 1 from the handtowelholder 2.

2> go to sinkbasin 1
On the sinkbasin 1, you see nothing.
3> put handtowel 1 in/on sinkbasin 1
You put the handtowel 1 in/on the sinkbasin 1.
Cumulative reward dominates!
4> put handtowel 1 in/on handtowelholder 1
Nothing happens.
5> take handtowel 1 from sinkbasin 1
You pick up the handtowel 1 from the sinkbasin 1.

6> put handtowel 1 in/on sinkbasin 1
You put the handtowel 1 in/on the sinkbasin 1.
7> take handtowel 1 from sinkbasin 1
You pick up the handtowel 1 from the sinkbasin 1.
Cumulative reward dominates!
8> put handtowel 1 in/on sinkbasin 1
You put the handtowel 1 in/on the sinkbasin 1.
9> take handtowel 1 from sinkbasin 1
You pick up the handtowel 1 from the sinkbasin 1.
